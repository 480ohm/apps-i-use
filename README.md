# The Apps I Use

This is intended as a personal reference because I'm new to Linux as a desktop OS and I've been distro hopping...and occasionally forgetting what apps I have enjoyed using.

## Command Line
* vtop (installed via "npm -g install vtop" after install npm)
* tmux

## Gaming
* Steam
* Lutris (sudo add-apt-repository ppa:lutris-team/lutris)
